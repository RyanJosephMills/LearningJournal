Problem
When first starting this semester, I was immediately struck with a learning problem as I had never used Unity when starting from scratch in year 1. We had mostly been given a project that had gotten most of the simple parts out of the way and didnâ€™t require us to do anything, and when I was at college for the two years of my course, I never used Unity as my course would only ever use Unreal engine.
Solution
The only way that I was able to solve this problem was to go onto YouTube and the official Unity website, and I had to learn the basic tools on how to start a Unity project for example coding the basic coding of the character's movement and the  ability to make the player jump and final adding gravity to the player.

Problem
A problem that I have come across in making my first bit of code for my character's movement is that the screen mouse will not mount to the centre of the screen and is completely visible. I have had a look around at some people code online; however, I have not been able to solve the problem so one way I will try and solve this problem is by asking around in class and see if people in class can point me in the correct direction

I hadn't had much experience in making Video's using OBS on my laptop before so I had to follow tutorials online in order to get more experience in how to make videos on OBS

Problem
I am struggling to develop a decent idea in the 3D style of game that I can do within the time limit. This is because I have very little knowledge of Unity as a whole so I am finding 3D game designs much harder
Solution
A way that I am going to counter this is instead of going into a 3D design, I will go into the 2D design and make a game like that, as it will be much easier and simpler to think about
