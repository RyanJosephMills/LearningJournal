Problem
When first starting this semester I was immediately struck with a learning problem as I had never used Unity when starting from scratch as in year 1 we had mostly been given a project that had gotten most of the simple parts out the way and didnâ€™t require us to do anything and when I was at collage for the two years of my course I never used Unity as my course would only ever use Unreal engine.
Solution
The only way that I was able to solve this problem was that I had to go onto YouTube and the official Unity website and I had to learn the basic tools on how to start a Unity project for example coding the basic coding of the characters movement and the  ability to make the player jump and final adding gravity to the player.

Problem
A problem that I have come across in making my first bit of code for my characters movement is that the screen mouse will not mount to the centre of the screen and is completely visible I have had a look around at some peoples code online however I have not been able to solve the problem so one way I will try and solve this problem is by asking around in class and see if people in class can point me in the correct direction

Problem
I am struggling to come up with a decent idea in the 3D style of game that I can do within the time limit this is because I have very little knowledge on unity as a whole so I am finding 3D game designs much harder
Solution
A way that I am going to counter this is instead of going into a 3D design I will go into the 2D design and just make a game like that as it will be much easier and simpler to think about
